## On-Campus Professional Development and Workshops

[**Graduate Student Workshops (includes writing CV/resume workshops)**](https://writing.wisc.edu/workshops/graduates/)

Broad resource which links to and describes a lot of free workshops available to UW-Madison faculty and students. There are a fair amount of workshops offered by the Writing Center for how to prepare an effective CV/resume/cover letter. This is updated every semester so if there's nothing that you find helpful check the next semester. As a student we get **10 free** consultations with the writing center, so use it!

Broad, but great database that the Graduate School provides encompassing all professional development resources offered to graduate students. This includes, but isn't limited to, in person, online, small group workshops, and a lot of online resources.
